## Go to Symbol

Opening the `Command Palette` and typing the `@` symbol initiates the `Go to Symbol` view which allows you to navigate around inside a Puppet manifest more quickly.

## Open Symbol by Name

Pressing `Ctrl+T` (or âŒ˜T on OSX) will list all [Puppet Custom Types](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/custom_types.html), [Functions](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/lang_write_functions_in_puppet.html), [Classes](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/lang_classes.html) and [Defined Types](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/lang_defined_types.html) in the workspace. You can then [navigate to the symbol](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_open-symbol-by-name) by pressing `Enter`.
